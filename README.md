### Description

This user control is intended to mimic the ChasingArrows control that one finds in RealBasic(R) for the Macintosh. The purpose of this control is to show the user of your program that the program is either busy or is doing something in the background. It gives the user the piece of mind that the program hasn't frozen while thinking. It basically sits on a form and spins in a clockwise pattern indefinately. The control includes a property called "Enabled" which can be set to either True (it will spin) or False (it sill stop wherever it is). This will not spin during design time. This control and all of its code, in whole and in part, is Copyright Bamco Products 2005, All Rights Reserved. Please do not modify the code without express written permission by Bamco Products. This control can be included in any program that you wish without notifying us, unless you will be selling your program for any ammount of currency. I do not charge for this control; I simply want to know where it's going. Please respect Copyrights!
